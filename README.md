# Minesweeper
Created the popular game of Minesweeper. Created a back-end model for the game as well as a GUI that uses the back-end to display and control the game.


## What I Learned

* How to create GUI projects using the Model-View-Controller organization method
* Learned how to use JFrames, JPanels, and GUI Widgets to display data in a GUI rather than just the command line
